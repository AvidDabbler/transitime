The complete core Java software for the Transitime real-time transit information project. The goal is to use real-time GPS data to make useful public transportation information readily available for. The system is for both letting passengers know the status of their vehicles and helping agencies more effectively manage their systems. By providing a complete open-source system agencies can have a cost effective system and have full ownership of it. 

The software is currently being tested in a production environment.
