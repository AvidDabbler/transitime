06:43:52.477 Config param transitime.db.dbName="null" (the default value). Specifies the name of the database. If not set then the transitime.core.agencyId will be used.

06:43:52.483 Config param transitime.db.dbHost="null" (the default value). Specifies the name of the machine the database for the project resides on. Use null value to use values from hibernate config file. Set to "localhost" if database running on same machine as the core application.
