08:07:37.338 Config param transitime.db.storeDataInDatabase="true" (the default value). When in playback mode or some other situations don't want to store generated data such as arrivals/departures, events, and such to the database because only debugging.

08:07:37.342 Config param transitime.core.onlyNeedArrivalDepartures="false" (the default value). When batching large amount of AVL data through system to generate improved schedule time (as has been done for Zhengzhou) it takes huge amount of time to process everything. To speed things up you can set -Dtransitime.core.onlyNeedArrivalDepartures=true such that the system will be sped up by not generating nor logging predictions, not logging AVL data nor storing it in db, and not logging nor storing match data in db.

08:07:37.342 Config param transitime.core.pauseIfDbQueueFilling="false" (the default value). When in batch mode can flood db with lots of objects. Iftransitime.core.pauseIfDbQueueFilling is set to true then when objects are put into the DataDbLogger queue the calling thread will be temporarily suspended so that the separate thread can run to write to the db and thereby empty out the queue.

08:07:37.386 Config param transitime.core.maxDistanceFromSegmentForAutoAssigning="60.0" (the default value). How far a location can be from a path segment and still be considered a match when auto assigning a vehicle. Auto assigning is treated separately because sometimes need to make maxDistanceFromSegment really lenient because vehicles do not always follow same route. This is especially true with deviated fixed route service. But don't want the distance to be too lenient when auto assigning because if too lenient then would match to multiple routes and therefore no assignment would be made because the matches would be ambiguous. Therefore maxDistanceFromSegmentForAutoAssigning should be lessthan or equal to maxDistanceFromSegment.

08:07:37.387 Config param transitime.core.allowableNumberOfBadMatches="2" (the default value). How many bad spatial/temporal matches a predictable vehicle can have in a row before the vehicle is made unpredictable.

How far along path past a layover stop a vehicle needs to be in order for it to be considered an early departure instead of just moving around within the layover. Needs to be a decent distance since the stop locations are not always accurate.

08:07:37.402 Config param transitime.core.layoverDistance="2000.0" (the default value). How far vehicle can be away from layover stop and still match to it. For when not deadheading to a trip. This can be useful to determine when a vehicle is pulled out of service when it is expected to be at a layover and start the next trip. Should usually be a pretty large value so that vehicles are not taken out of service just because they drive a bit away from the stop for the layover, which is pretty common.

08:07:37.402 Config param transitime.core.allowableEarlyTimeForEarlyDepartureSecs="300" (the default value). How early in seconds a vehicle can have left terminal and have it be considered an early departure instead of just moving around within the layover.

08:07:37.402 Config param transitime.core.exclusiveBlockAssignments="true" (the default value). True if block assignments should be exclusive. If set to true then when a vehicle is assigned to a block the system will unassign any other vehicles that were assigned to the block. Important for when AVL system doesn't always provide logout info. Also used by the AutoBlockAssigner to determine which active blocks to possibly assign a vehicle to.

08:08:28.540 Config param transitime.core.exclusiveBlockAssignments="true" (the default value). True if block assignments should be exclusive. If set to true then when a vehicle is assigned to a block the system will unassign any other vehicles that were assigned to the block. Important for when AVL system doesn't always provide logout info. Also used by the AutoBlockAssigner to determine which active blocks to possibly assign a vehicle to. For no schedule routes can set to false to allow multiple vehicles be assigned to a route.

08:08:28.540 Config param transitime.core.timeForDeterminingNoProgress="480000" (the default value). The interval in msec at which look at vehicle's history to determine if it is not making any progress. A valueof 0 disables this feature.

08:08:28.541 Config param transitime.core.minDistanceForDelayed="60.0" (the default value). Minimum distance vehicle is expected to travel over timeForDeterminingDelayed to indicate vehicle is delayed.

08:08:28.541 Config param transitime.core.matchHistoryMaxSize="20" (the default value). How many matches are kept in history for vehicle so that can can do things such as look back at history to determine if vehicle has broken down. Should be large enough so can store all matchets generated over timeForDeterminingNoProgress. If GPS rate is high then this value will need to be high as well.

08:08:28.541 Config param transitime.core.avlHistoryMaxSize="20" (the default value). How many AVL reports are kept in history for vehicle so that can can do things such as look back at history to determine if vehicle has broken down. Should be large enough so can store all AVL reports received over timeForDeterminingNoProgress. If GPS rate is high then this value will need to be high as well.

08:08:28.541 Config param transitime.core.pidDirectory="/home/ec2-user/pids/" (the default value). Directory where pid file should be written. The pid file can be used by monit to make sure that core process is always running.

08:08:28.542 Config param transitime.core.agencyId="02" instead of the default of "null". Specifies the ID of the agency. Used for the database name and in the logback configuration to specify the directory where to put the log files.

08:08:28.583 Config param transitime.db.dbName="null" (the default value). Specifies the name of the database. If not set then the transitime.core.agencyId will be used.

08:08:28.584 Config param transitime.db.dbHost="null" (the default value). Specifies the name of the machine the database for the project resides on. Use null value to use values from hibernate config file. Set to "localhost" if database running on same machine as the core application.

08:08:28.584 Config param transitime.db.dbType="mysql" (the default value). Specifies type of database when creating the URL to connect to the database. Can be mysql or postgresql. Should work for other dbs as well. Default is mysql.

08:08:28.584 Config param transitime.db.dbUserName="null" (the default value). Specifies login for the project database. Use null value to use values from hibernate config file.

08:08:28.584 Config param transitime.db.socketTimeoutSec="60" (the default value). So can set low-level socket timeout for JDBC connections. Useful for when a session dies during a request, such as for when a db is rebooted. Set to 0 to have no timeout.

08:08:28.584 Config param transitime.hibernate.configFile="hsql_hibernate.cfg.xml" (the default value). Specifies the database dependent hibernate.cfg.xml file to use to configure hibernate. The system will look both on the file system and in the classpath. Can specify mysql_hibernate.cfg.xml or postgres_hibernate.cfg.xml

08:08:32.916 Config param transitime.timeout.pollingRateSecs="30" (the default value). Specifies in seconds how frequently the TimeoutHandler should actually look for timeouts. Don't want to do this too frequently because because TimeoutHandler.handlePossibleTimeout() is called with every new AVL report and it has to look at every vehicle to see if has been timed out.

08:08:32.916 Config param transitime.timeout.allowableNoAvlSecs="360" (the default value). For AVL timeouts. If don't get an AVL report for the vehicle in this amount of time in seconds then the vehicle will be made non-predictable.

08:08:32.916 Config param transitime.timeout.allowableNoAvlAfterSchedDepartSecs="360" (the default value). If a vehicle is at a wait stop, such as sitting at a terminal, and doesn't provide an AVL report for this number of seconds then the vehicle is made unpredictable. Important because sometimes vehicles don't report AVL at terminals because they are powered down. But don't want to continue to provide predictions for long after scheduled departure time if vehicle taken out of service.

08:08:32.917 Config param transitime.service.minutesIntoMorningToIncludePreviousServiceIds="240" (the default value). Early in the morning also want to include at service IDs for previous day since a block might have started on that day. But don't want to always include previous day service IDs since that confuses things. Therefore just include them if before this time of the day, in minutes.

08:08:32.927 When reading parameter "transitime.avl.url" for agencyId=02 no valid value was configured and no default was specified so resulting value is null.

08:08:32.927 When reading parameter "transitime.avl.authenticationPassword" for agencyId=02 no valid value was configured and no default was specified so resulting value is null.

08:08:32.927 Config param transitime.avl.authenticationPassword="null" (the default value). If authentication used for the feed then this specifies the password.

08:08:32.928 Config param transitime.avl.shouldProcessAvl="true" (the default value). Usually want to process the AVL data when it is read in so that predictions and such are generated. But if debugging then can set this param to false.

08:08:32.930 Config param transitime.avl.shouldUseJms="false" (the default value). Specifies whether should use JMS queue for handling AVL reports. Useful for if feed is read on one machine but processed on another.

08:08:32.930 Config param transitime.avl.feedPollingRateSecs="5" (the default value). How frequently an AVL feed should be polled for new data.

08:08:32.930 Config param transitime.avl.feedTimeoutInMSecs="10000" (the default value). For when polling AVL XML feed. The feed logs error if the timeout value is exceeded when performing the XML request.

08:08:32.930 Config param transitime.avl.maxSpeed="31.3" (the default value). Max speed between AVL reports for a vehicle. If this value is exceeded then the AVL report is ignored.

08:08:32.930 Config param transitime.avl.minSpeedForValidHeading="1.5" (the default value). If AVL report speed is below this threshold then the heading is not considered valid.

08:08:32.930 Config param transitime.avl.minLatitude="15.0" (the default value). For filtering out bad AVL reports. The default values of latitude 15.0 to 55.0 and longitude of -135.0 to -60.0 are for North America, including Mexico and Canada.

08:08:32.930 Config param transitime.avl.maxLongitude="-60.0" (the default value). For filtering out bad AVL reports. The default values of latitude 15.0 to 55.0 and longitude of -135.0 to -60.0 are for North America, including Mexico and Canada. Can see maps of lat/lon at http://www.mapsofworld.com/lat_long/north-america.html

08:08:32.930 Config param transitime.avl.unpredictableAssignmentsRegEx="" (the default value). So can filter out unpredictable assignments such as for training coaches, service vehicles, or simply vehicles that are not in service and should not be attempted to be made predictable. Returns empty string, the default value if transitime.avl.unpredictableAssignmentsRegEx is not set.

08:08:32.930 Config param transitime.avl.minTimeBetweenAvlReportsSecs="5" (the default value). Minimum allowable time in seconds between AVL reports for a vehicle. If get a report closer than this number of seconds to the previous one then the new report is filtered out and not processed. Important for when reporting rate is really high, such as every few seconds.

08:08:32.930 Config param transitime.avl.shouldLogToStdOut="false" (the default value). For debugging. Logs each AVL report to stdout if set to true. Default is false.

08:08:32.932 Config param transitime.rmi.rmiHost="null" (the default value). For a client that needs to connect to an agency server. When null system gets RMI host name from the WebAgencies table in the web database. But when doing simple calls using this parameter eliminates the need to connect to the web database, speeding up testing.

08:08:32.932 Config param transitime.rmi.rmiPort="2099" (the default value). Which port to use for RMI calls. Usually RMI uses port 1099 but using default of 2099 to not interfere with other RMI based applications.

08:08:32.932 Config param transitime.rmi.secondaryRmiPort="2098" (the default value). Which secondary port to use for RMI calls, for once initial communication has been established. Usually RMI uses port 0 which means any port. But then can't configure firewall to limit access to specific ports. Therefore using default value of 2098 so that the port is consistent. Every server on a machine must use a different secondary port for communication.
